In this work, we propose the use of the norm of the\ntangent map, obtained from differentiable tracking of particle trajectories, as\na computationally efficient indicator of chaotic behavior in phase space. In\nmany cases, a one-turn or few-turn tangent map is sufficient for this purpose,\nsignificantly reducing the computational cost associated with dynamic aperture\noptimization. As an illustrative application, the proposed indicator is\nemployed in the dynamic aperture optimization of an ALS-U lattice design."}

Their interaction with water leads to the formation of\nplasma-activated water (PAW), whose chemical activity depends on discharge\nconditions. In this work, a helium-air (14:1) micro-plasma jet operated in a\nring-to-ring electrode configuration is used to generate PAW and study its\ninfluence on the growth of Chrysanthemum saplings. Optical emission\nspectroscopy (OES) confirms the presence of $N_2$ bands and He lines, with the\nHe-air mixture providing more chemically active discharge (in terms of favoring\nthe generation of nitrates in PAW) as compared to pure helium. The\nphysicochemical characteristics of PAW such as pH, electrical conductivity\n(EC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and total dissolved solids (TDS) are\nanalyzed as a function of plasma treatment time and water volume. The optimum\ncondition for PAW generation is found to be 12 ml of de-ionized (DI) water\ntreated for 40 minutes, which yields the highest ORP and nitrate concentration\nwith a reduced pH. Comparative growth experiments over two weeks show that\nPAW-treated Chrysanthemum saplings exhibit significantly greater height (10.2\ncm) and soil fertility (2580 $\\mu$S/cm) than those watered with same amount of\nDI water or tap water. The results highlight the potential of PAW for\nsustainable enhancement of growth of flowering plants."}

While DLA\nin high-density plasma optimizes the energy transfer from a laser pulse to\nelectrons, it exacerbates nonlinear propagation effects, such as filamentation,\nthat can disrupt the acceleration process. Here, we show that superluminal\nflying-focus pulses (FFPs) mitigate nonlinear propagation, thereby enhancing\nthe number of high-energy electrons and resulting x-ray yield.\nThree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, compared to a\nGaussian pulse of equal energy (1 J) and intensity (2x10^20 W/cm^2), an FFP\nproduces 80x more electrons above 100 MeV, increases the electron cutoff energy\nby 20%, triples the high-energy x-ray yield, and improves x-ray collimation.\nThese results illustrate the ability of spatiotemporally structured laser\npulses to provide additional control in the highly nonlinear, relativistic\nregime of laser-plasma interactions."}

It is found\nthat in the Hall-MHD regime, both whistler waves and ion-cyclotron waves can\nextract energy from the flow shear, resulting in two distinct branches of\nglobal instability. The non-axisymmetric whistler modes grow significantly\nfaster than non-axisymmetric, ideal MHD modes. A discussion of the whistler\ninstability mechanism is presented in the large-ion-skin-depth, `electron-MHD'\nlimit. It is observed that the effect of the Hall term on the non-axisymmetric\nmodes can be appreciable when $d_i$ is on the order of a few % of the width of\nthe cylindrical annulus. Distinct global modes emerge in the Hall-MHD regime at\nsignificantly stronger magnetic fields than those required for unstable global\nMHD modes."}
