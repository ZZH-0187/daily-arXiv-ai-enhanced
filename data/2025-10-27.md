Abstract: Turbulence is fundamental to energy transfer across scales in space and
astrophysical plasmas. Bow shock interactions have long been hypothesized to
significantly modify turbulence in planetary environments, yet the
quantification of such effects and their parametric dependencies remain largely
unaddressed. Using in situ long-term high-time resolution measurements from
NASA's MAVEN mission, we report the first observational characterization of the
evolution and parametric dependence of the turbulence energy cascade rate
$\varepsilon_C$ at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales. Key findings reveal an
averaged three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in $\varepsilon_C$ when
transitioning from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. Notably, downstream
measurements of oblique and quasi-perpendicular shocks exhibit higher energy
dissipation rates than those of quasi-parallel configurations. These results
provide the first direct evidence linking shock obliquity to turbulence
amplification, offering key insights into shock-mediated turbulence in similar
but inaccessible systems.

Abstract: We present calculations of diffusion coefficients in grain boundaries in
Yukawa crystals for astrophysics. Our methods follow from our recent work
calculating diffusion coefficients in perfect body-centered cubic crystals.
These diffusion coefficients show only a weak dependence on the crystal
orientations at the grain boundary and are consistent with those expected for a
supercooled liquid scaled down by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that
the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential
barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly
reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This
also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not
exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal. These diffusion coefficients
suggest that grain boundaries may be a dominant source of viscous dissipation
in neutron star crusts.

Abstract: Inhomogeneous mixing and the consequent mesoscopic layered structure have
been observed in many physical systems, including magnetically confined fusion
plasmas. Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence
spreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due
to the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly,
blobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a
state of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper,
we first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids:
how turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced
turbulence spreading for the power decay length, and the interaction between
blobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental
results on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers.
Staircases are often elusive and different complementary methods have been
utilized to identify them, but our understanding is still incomplete. This
paper serves as an initial step toward applying insights gained from
inhomogeneous mixing due to blobs/voids to the understanding of a staircase.

Abstract: Astrophysical systems exhibit a rich diversity of outflow morphologies, yet
their mechanisms and existence conditions remain among the most persistent
puzzles in the field. Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on
laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic
astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated
jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles.
Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined
by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the
relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal
pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2
and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by
magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing
and future astronomical observations. Our findings provide a quantitative
framework for understanding astrophysical outflows.

Abstract: Low-temperature plasmas are essential to both fundamental scientific research
and critical industrial applications. As in many areas of science, numerical
simulations have become a vital tool for uncovering new physical phenomena and
guiding technological development. Code benchmarking remains crucial for
verifying implementations and evaluating performance. This work continues the
Landmark benchmark initiative, a series specifically designed to support the
verification of low-temperature plasma codes. In this study, seventeen
simulation codes from a collaborative community of nineteen international
institutions modeled a partially magnetized ExB Penning discharge. The
emergence of large scale coherent structures, or rotating plasma spokes, endows
this configuration with an enormous range of time scales, making it
particularly challenging to simulate. The codes showed excellent agreement on
the rotation frequency of the spoke as well as key plasma properties, including
time-averaged ion density, plasma potential, and electron temperature profiles.
Achieving this level of agreement came with challenges, and we share lessons
learned on how to conduct future benchmarking campaigns. Comparing code
implementations, computational hardware, and simulation runtimes also revealed
interesting trends, which are summarized with the aim of guiding future plasma
simulation software development.

Abstract: Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\gamma$-ray bursts, supernova
explosions, and magnetar flares occur in collisionless plasmas and involve
various plasma kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. In this paper, we
explore the spectral trends of the Weibel instability using spectral analysis
of particle-in-cell simulations. Power dependence on viewing angle and
frequency are explored and the relation to the results of the first paper in
this series is discussed.

Abstract: Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\gamma$-ray bursts and supernova
explosion-driven shocks in collisionless plasmas, involve various plasma
kinetic instabilities, such as the Weibel instability. These systems support
various types of particle acceleration and radiation through a variety of
mechanisms. In this paper, we explore the energy transformations and dynamical
effects of violent filament mergers seen between the large current filaments
formed by the Weibel instability. The radiative processes involved in the
Weibel instability filament building are also discussed in relation to jitter
and synchrotron radiation.

Abstract: Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the
magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned
coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate
singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes,
which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when
simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present
an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned
coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D
axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy
Production (STEP).

Abstract: PIP-II is a superconducting linac that is in the initial acceleration chain
for the Fermilab accelerator complex. The RF system consists of a warm
front-end with an RFQ and buncher cavities along with 25 superconducting
cryo-modules comprised of cavities with five different acceleration \(\beta\).
The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a
total of 125 RF cavities. Various components of the LLRF system have been
tested with and without beam at the PIP-II test stands. The LLRF system design
is derived from the LCLS-II project with its self-excited loop architecture
used in the majority of the cryo-modules. The PIP-II beam loading at 2 mA is
much higher than the LCLS-II linac. The control system architecture is analyzed
and evaluated for the operational limits of feedback gains and their ability to
meet the project regulation requirements for cavity field amplitude and phase
regulation.
