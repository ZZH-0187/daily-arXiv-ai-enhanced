Bow shock interactions have long been hypothesized to\nsignificantly modify turbulence in planetary environments, yet the\nquantification of such effects and their parametric dependencies remain largely\nunaddressed. Using in situ long-term high-time resolution measurements from\nNASA's MAVEN mission, we report the first observational characterization of the\nevolution and parametric dependence of the turbulence energy cascade rate\n$\\varepsilon_C$ at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales. Key findings reveal an\naveraged three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in $\\varepsilon_C$ when\ntransitioning from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. Notably, downstream\nmeasurements of oblique and quasi-perpendicular shocks exhibit higher energy\ndissipation rates than those of quasi-parallel configurations. These results\nprovide the first direct evidence linking shock obliquity to turbulence\namplification, offering key insights into shock-mediated turbulence in similar\nbut inaccessible systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that\nthe local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential\nbarriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly\nreducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid.

Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence\nspreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due\nto the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly,\nblobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a\nstate of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper,\nwe first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids:\nhow turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced\nturbulence spreading for the power decay length, and the interaction between\nblobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental\nresults on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers.\nStaircases are often elusive and different complementary methods have been\nutilized to identify them, but our understanding is still incomplete.
