Using a reductive perturbation approach, we derive a\nKorteweg de Vries (KdV) equation that governs the nonlinear evolution of KA\nsolitons in this environment. The soliton amplitude and width are shown to\ndepend sensitively on key pulsar observables, including spin period, spin-down\nrate, and pair multiplicity as well as plasma composition and suprathermal\nparticle distributions. Our analysis reveals that soliton structures are\nstrongly influenced by the presence of heavy ions, kappa-distributed pairs, and\noblique propagation angles. Heavier ion species such as Fe26+ produce\nsignificantly broader solitons due to enhanced inertia and dispersion, while\nincreasing pair multiplicity leads to smaller solitons through stronger\nscreening. Oblique propagation (larger theta) results in wider but\nlower-amplitude solitons, and more thermalized pair plasmas (higher kappa)\nsupport taller and broader structures. A population-level analysis of 1174\npulsars shows a clear positive correlation between soliton width and spin\nperiod, with millisecond pulsars hosting the narrowest solitons. By linking\nsoliton dynamics to measurable pulsar parameters, this work provides a\nframework for interpreting magnetospheric microphysics and its role in shaping\npulsar emission signatures."}

Plasma Physics 88,905880306 (2022)]. The\nCSSC is an optimized stellarator obtained by direct optimization via coil\nshapes, with its coil topology similar to that of the Columbia Non-neutral\nTorus (CNT) [Pederson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 205002 (2002)]. Due to its\nvacuum-based optimization, the CSSC exhibits detrimental finite beta effects on\nneoclassical confinement. The results of optimization show that the finite beta\neffects can be largely mitigated by reducing the coil currents of CSSC."}

Haw", "Jocelino Rodrigues"], "title": "Design and Implementation of a Fast-Sweeping Langmuir Probe Diagnostic for DC Arc Jet Environments", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Review of Scientific Instruments, October\n  2025", "summary": "Langmuir probe diagnostics are a cornerstone of plasma characterization,\nproviding critical measurements of electron temperature, electron density, and\nplasma potential. However, conventional swept Langmuir probes and other\ntraditional electrostatic probes often lack the temporal resolution necessary\nto capture transient plasma behavior in dynamic environments. This paper\npresents the design and implementation of a fast-sweeping Langmuir probe system\nthat is open-source, low-cost, and adaptable for a wide range of plasma\napplications. The probe system incorporates voltage sweeping to resolve rapid\nfluctuations in plasma parameters at a temporal resolution of up to 200 kHz. To\nvalidate its performance, the system was implemented in the 30 kW miniature Arc\njet Research Chamber (mARC II), a high-enthalpy DC arc jet facility designed\nfor prototype testing and development. Experimental results demonstrate the\nprobe's capability to operate in extreme aerothermal conditions, providing\ntime-resolved electron temperature and density along the flow's radial profile.\nThis work establishes a robust and accessible Langmuir diagnostic solution for\nresearchers studying transient plasma behavior in high-enthalpy environments."}

As the nonlocal models for\nelectron heat conduction have been developed for modeling kinetic effects on\nheat flux in hydrodynamic scale, modeling kinetic effects on magnetic field are\nstill restricted to flux limiters instead of nonlocal corrections. We propose a\nnew nonlocal model which can recover the kinetic effects for heat conduction\nand magnetic field in hydrodynamic scale simultaneously. We clarify the\nnecessity of self-consistently considering the electric field corrections in\nnonlocal models to get reasonable physical quantities. Using the new nonlocal\nmodel, the nonlocal corrections of transport coefficients in magnetized plasma\nand the magnetic field generation without density gradients are systematically\nstudied. We find nonlocal effects significantly change the magnetic field\ndistribution in laser ablation, which potentially influences the hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in ICF."}

In order to extract\nproperties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF\nneeds to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al. Nature Commun. 13, 7911\n(2022)] has suggested that the SIF may be deconvolved using the two-sided\nLaplace transform. However, the extracted information can depend strongly on\nthe shape of the input SIF, and the SIF is in practice challenging to measure\naccurately. Here, we propose an alternative approach: we demonstrate that\nconsidering ratios of Laplace-transformed XRTS spectra collected at different\nscattering angles is equivalent to performing the deconvolution, but without\nthe need for explicit knowledge of the SIF. From these ratios, it is possible\nto directly extract the temperature from the scattering spectra, when the\nsystem is in thermal equilibrium. We find the method to be generally robust to\nspectral noise and physical differences between the spectrometers, and we\nexplore situations in which the method breaks down. Furthermore, the fact that\nconsistent temperatures can be extracted for systems in thermal equilibrium\nindicates that non-equilibrium effects could be identified by inconsistent\ntemperatures of a few eV between the ratios of three or more scattering angles."}
