Electrons are evolved with a second-order\nStrang-split 1D1V Wigner-Poisson solver that couples conservative\nsemi-Lagrangian WENO advection to an analytic Fourier space update for the\nnon-local Wigner term, while ions remain classical. Short, frequency-tuned\nponderomotive pulses drive KEEN formation in a uniform Maxwellian plasma; as\nthe dimensionless quantum parameter H rises from the classical limit to values\nrelevant to warm-dense matter, doped semiconductors, and 2D electron systems,\nthe drive threshold increases, higher harmonics are damped, trapped electron\nvortices diffuse, and the subplasma electrostatic energy relaxes to a lower\nstationary level, as confirmed by continuous wavelet analysis. These\nmicroscopic changes carry macroscopic weight. Ignition-scale capsules now\ncompress matter to regimes where the electron de Broglie wavelength rivals the\nDebye length, making classical kinetic descriptions insufficient. By extending\nKEEN physics into this quantum domain, our results offer a potential diagnostic\nof nonequilibrium electron dynamics for next-generation inertial-confinement\ndesigns and high-energy-density platforms, indicating that predictive fusion\nmodeling may benefit from the integration of kinetic fidelity with quantum\neffects."}

Zhang"], "title": "Effect of flow-aligned external magnetic fields on mushroom instability", "comment": "Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Mushroom instability (MI) is a shear instability considered responsible for\ngenerating and amplifying magnetic fields in relativistic jets. While\nastrophysical jets are usually considered to be magnetized, how MI acts in\nmagnetized jets remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the\neffect of a flow-aligned external magnetic field on MI, with both theoretical\nanalyses and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the limit of a cold and\ncollisionless plasma, we derive a generalized dispersion relation for linear\ngrowth rates of the magnetized MIs. Numerical solutions of the dispersion\nrelation reveal that the external magnetic field always suppresses the growth\nof MI, though MIs are much more robust to the external magnetic field than\nelectron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHIs). Analyses are also\nextended to instabilities with an arbitrary wavevector in the shear interface\nplane. Two-dimensional PIC simulations of single-mode MIs reach a good\nagreement with our analytical predictions. In simulations with finite\ntemperatures, we observe the competition and cooperation between MIs and a\ndiffusion-induced DC magnetic field."}

This paper presents a novel,\nphysics-informed indicator for early MARFE prediction and disruption warning\ndeveloped for the HL-3 tokamak. Our framework integrates two core innovations:\n(1) a high-fidelity label refinement pipeline that employs a physics-scored,\nweighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to systematically correct\nnoise and artifacts in raw visual data from cameras, and (2) a continuous-time,\nphysics-constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) model\nthat predicts the short-horizon ``worsening\" of a MARFE. By conditioning the\nmodel's dynamics on key plasma parameters such as normalized density ($f_G$,\nderived from core electron density) and core electron temperature ($T_e$), the\npredictor achieves superior performance in the low-false-alarm regime crucial\nfor control. On a large experimental dataset from HL-3, our model demonstrates\nhigh predictive accuracy, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.969 for\n40ms-ahead prediction. The indicator has been successfully deployed for\nreal-time operation with updates every 1 ms. This work lays a very foundation\nfor future proactive MARFE mitigation."}

It is a finite element (FE) model based on a homogenization\napproach enabling efficient and accurate simulation of the transient magnetic\nresponse of superconducting Rutherford cables without explicitly representing\nindividual strands. The DISCC model reproduces the inter-strand coupling\ncurrent dynamics via a novel mixed FE formulation, and can be combined with the\nReduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) and Flux (ROHF) models applied at\nthe strand level in order to reproduce the internal strand dynamics:\nhysteresis, eddy, and inter-filament coupling currents, as well as ohmic\neffects. We first analyze the performance of the DISCC model alone, as a linear\nproblem. We then extend the analysis to include the internal strand dynamics\nthat make the problem nonlinear. In all cases, the DISCC model offers a massive\nreduction of the computational time compared to conventional fully detailed FE\nmodels while still accounting for all types of loss, magnetization and\ninductance contributions. Rutherford cables homogenized with the DISCC model\ncan be directly included in FE models of magnet cross-sections for efficient\nelectro-magneto-thermal simulations of their transient response. We present two\npossible FE formulations for the implementation of the DISCC model, a first one\nbased on the h-phi-formulation, and a second one based on the\nh-phi-a-formulation, which is well suited for an efficient treatment of the\nferromagnetic regions in magnet cross-sections."}
